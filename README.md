Mini Alarm Clock in Python

This Python code implements a simple alarm clock with the following features:

User Input: It prompts you to enter the desired alarm duration in both minutes and seconds.
Countdown Timer: While the alarm is counting down, it displays a clear timer in the console, updating every second.
Alarm Sound: Once the set time elapses, the code plays a customizable alarm sound using an MP3 file named alarm.mp3 (located in the same directory).
In essence, it allows you to:

Set an alarm for a specific duration.
Visually track the remaining time using a countdown timer.
Be alerted by an audible sound when the alarm goes off.# alarm-clock
# alarm-clock
