# Mini Alarm Clock in Python

### This Python code implements a simple alarm clock with the following features:

1-User Input: It prompts you to enter the desired alarm duration in both minutes and seconds.

2- Countdown Timer: While the alarm is counting down, it displays a clear timer in the console, updating every second.

3- Alarm Sound: Once the set time elapses, the code plays a customizable alarm sound using an MP3 file named alarm.mp3 (located in the same directory).

### In essence, it allows you to:

- Set an alarm for a specific duration.
- Visually track the remaining time using a countdown timer.
- Be alerted by an audible sound when the alarm goes off.
